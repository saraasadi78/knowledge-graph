Managing Big Data: Knowledge Graph Implementation with Neo4j 

This project focuses on creating a Knowledge Graph using Neo4j's graph database management system and the Cypher language.

The Knowledge Graph serves as a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing big data and complex datasets, enabling efficient data representation and exploration.

## Features:

Graph Database: Utilized Neo4j's graph database to store and manage interconnected data, enhancing the representation of complex relationships.

Flexible Data Modeling: Leveraged Neo4j's NoSQL structure for flexible data modeling, accommodating evolving data requirements.

Efficient Querying: Neo4j's Cypher language simplified complex queries, ensuring quick and precise data retrieval and analysis.

User Interface: Designed and implemented a user-friendly website as a front-end interface to access and interact with the Knowledge Graph easily.
